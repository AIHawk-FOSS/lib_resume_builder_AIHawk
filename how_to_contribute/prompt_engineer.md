## Creating and Adding Your Custom Prompts

### 1. **Design Your Custom Prompt**

Create a new prompt that enhances or expands the resume creation capabilities. Below are examples of key areas to cover:

- **Header Prompt**:
  Ensures contact information is formatted clearly, including full name, location, phone, email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links. Omit fields if data is `None`.

- **Education Prompt**:
  Describes educational background, including institution, degree, grade, and coursework, if relevant to the job description.

- **Work Experience Prompt**:
  Details work experience, aligning responsibilities, achievements, and skills with the job description. Uses keywords, quantifies results where possible, and achieves high alignment with the userâ€™s existing experience.

- **Side Projects Prompt**:
  Highlights notable projects with links, recognition, and technical contributions.

- **Achievements and Certifications Prompts**:
  Lists significant achievements, awards, and certifications relevant to the job, including brief descriptions and relevance.

- **Additional Skills Prompt**:
  Lists specific skills or technologies, including proficiency levels and experience.

### **Example Prompts:**

Use these as a starting point for writing your own:
```python
from lib_resume_builder_AIHawk.template_base import *

prompt_header = """
Act as an HR expert specializing in ATS-friendly resumes. Your task is to create a professional resume header with:
- Contact Information: Include name, location, phone, email, LinkedIn, GitHub.
- Formatting: Ensure details are clear and readable.

If a field is missing (e.g., LinkedIn), omit it.

- **My information:**  
  {personal_information}
""" + prompt_header_template
